# Some other scripts

Just some other scripts that aren't Apple.

- wikitbl.pl: a perl script that converts simple text tables to wikipedia-style tables. No headings yet (which are desirable). Defaults to commas as the separators (which can also be forced using `-c`). Also can use tabs (with `-t`) or user-chosen with `-s <separator>`. Good for keeping data in csv or tab files and still make them available on wikipedia. Inspired by <http://wiki.crc.nd.edu/wiki/index.php/Convert_CSV_To_Wiki_Table>.
