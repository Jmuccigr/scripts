# Some other scripts

Just some other scripts that aren't Apple.

- wikitbl.pl: a perl script that converts simple text tables to wikipedia-style tables. No headings yet (which are desirable). Defaults to commas as the separators (but can also force using `-c`. Also can use tabs (with `-t`) or user-chosen with `-s <separator>`. Good for keeping data in csv or tab files and still make them available on wikipedia.
